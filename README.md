#  Observation 101
An attempt to try and understand the new `Observation` framework.

## Procedure
1. create a new project
1. implement a simple example with a master-detail showing items with a title in a list and enabling mutating this title in detail
1. make as many commits as needed to be able to show the flow of revelations (or frustrations?) while working on this to be able to create a blogpost from it afterwards
